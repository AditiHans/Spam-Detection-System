# Spam-Detection-System
📌 Project Overview

The Spam Detection System is an AI-powered application that identifies and filters spam messages in real-time, improving user safety and platform integrity.
Using a hybrid approach combining Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning, the project ensures high accuracy, low false-positive rates, and compliance with data privacy standards such as GDPR.

🎯 Objectives

Detect and filter spam messages instantly using AI models.

Minimize false detections and maintain high precision.

Support multilingual spam detection with adaptive learning.

Provide real-time executive dashboards for technical, financial, and privacy insights.

🧠 Dataset & Preprocessing

Source: Open text message dataset (spam/ham classification).

Total Messages: 50,000+ SMS samples.

Processing Steps:

Tokenization and cleaning.

Feature extraction (keyword frequency, URL count, message length).

Vectorization using TF-IDF.

Label encoding for supervised learning.
